This is a modern web app using Svelte (front-end, hosted on port 5000). The back-end is developed using both Java Spring Boot (running on port 3000) and FastAPI (on port 4000), handling the same functionalities. Communication between the front-end and the back-end is achieved through APIs, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
